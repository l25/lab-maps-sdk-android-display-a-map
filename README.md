## In this course you will learn:

* How to start your journey with TomTom Map SDK
* Write a simple Android Main Activity
* Connect with TomTom Web Services using TomTom developer portal

## Build the next generation of location experiences

In order to get a fully functional application you need to obtain a free API key by completing the registration on TomTom Developer Portal.

**WARNING:** Keep in mind that the API key is personal and can't be shared nor pushed to the public repository. By doing that you would violate terms and conditions.
